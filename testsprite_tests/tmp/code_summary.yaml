known_limitations:
  - issue: Backend API required for full functionality
    location: lib/api/index.ts
    impact: Most features require a running backend server at TALENTNG_API_URL
  - issue: Authentication tokens stored in localStorage
    location: lib/auth.ts
    impact: Tokens may be vulnerable to XSS attacks; consider httpOnly cookies
  - issue: Middleware deprecated warning
    location: middleware.ts
    impact: Next.js 16 shows deprecation warning for middleware convention
